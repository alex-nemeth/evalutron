# MCEA (Multi-Criteria Evaluation of Alternatives)

This project is a tool which serves as a **user-friendly** way to get an output from various methods of **multi-criteria evaluation of alternatives**.

The aim of this tool is to provide a way of getting such calculations with ease, requiring **as little input as possible**, therefore allowing the user to skip a lot of excel work, or often even coding.

The development of this web application is the main focus of my bachelor's thesis, and is built primarily with **Angular 17, RxJS & TailwindCSS**.
